# Project Ideas & Features

## 🚧 In Progress

- [ ] Dark Mode - provide theme support so that users can eventually select their own themes
- [x] Finish v1 base styles - wrapping up migration to Chakra UI v3 and the respective style updates
      that need to be completed to support the change over.

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Initial project setup - Basic React app with Create React App (Probably would use another
      method in the future)
- [x] Spell formatting functionality - Text formatting for spells
- [x] Basic tab functionality - Allows users to see spells specific to spell class rather than the
      entire deck at once.

## 🔮 Upcoming / Ideas

- [ ] Cards More Info Section - Cards should have a more info section to see damage info, ritual
      info, etc.
- [ ] Final Page Load Animation - On final page load - the animation should roll dice and then
      generate the 'spells of the day'
- [ ] Spells of The Day - Landing page where 12 spells are randomly selected
- [ ] All Spells Tab - Add all spells tab for future features such as sorting, filtering, etc.
- [ ] Sort and Filtering - Add sorting, filtering, etc. to the different spell classes as well
- [ ] Implement Search Functionality - Sort of speaks for itself.
- [ ] Session Spell Deck - this feature will need a lot of planning. But essentially allow users to
      select whatever cards they would like to add to their current session and give them option to
      'use' or 'burn' their card after usage for easy tracking within a play session.
- [ ] When a spell has be used the card should 'flip over' to indicate its not longer available for usage   whichout being removed from your spell deck
- [ ] Improve data loading plan - initial pass was to get things functional but there are a lot of
      inefficiencies to address. Also need to look at segmented loading options and improved caching
      strategy to improve overall experience and minimize resources.

## Todos

- Figure out whatever 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' is and why I'm using it anywhere
